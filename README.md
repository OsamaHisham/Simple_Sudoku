# Simple_Sudoku
A fun and simple sudoku game project that I have been interested in.

# Instructions on how to play the game:

[1] MOUSE:  attempt to solve it by clicking on the cells.

[2] VALUES:  after clicking the position to fill the value entered will be stored in a temporary value, by clicking ENTER the value will be inserted.

[3] BACKSPACE / DELETE:  anyone of these two is used to delete the temporary value if you hope to enter a new temporary value instead. You can even key in another value directly if you hope to change it before recording it by the enter key.

[4] SPACE:  If at any point the player decides to solve the board, the spacebar can be pressed. This will commence a visual that demonstrates how the backtracking algorithm is being applied in order to solve the board.

[5] H: Gives the user a hint. Displays a random correct value on the board.
